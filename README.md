# DCD - Dating Compatibility Database

Group Members: Forum Modi, Rebecca Harris, Allison Russell, Mark Boutros.

Group Name: Coding Cobras

Project Name: Dating Compatibility Database

Explanation: Fundamentally this is the database for a dating site that uses star sign and Myers-Briggs personality type compatibility to find potential matches. Each user will have parameters based on their age, location, gender, star sign, and Myers-Briggs personality. If two users have a high compatibility percentage they can be potential matches with parameters of the two usersâ€™ ids, their compatibility percentage and their decisions to swipe left (no) or right (yes). If both users swipe right then they are a match. Matches have messages that can include photos and gifs.
